🎵 Apple iTunes Music Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the iTunes music store dataset to extract actionable business intelligence.
By leveraging relational database queries, the analysis explores customer behavior, sales trends, product performance, and geographic distribution, providing a data-driven foundation for business growth strategies.

🚀 Problem Statement

Apple iTunes manages a vast digital music store with millions of tracks and thousands of customers worldwide.
The leadership team lacks a deep understanding of customer behavior, music preferences, and sales performance, which results in intuition-based decisions instead of data-driven strategies.

The goal of this project is to transform raw transactional data into strategic insights that improve:

Customer targeting

Product offerings

Operational efficiency

🎯 Business Goals

Understand customer behavior and purchasing trends.

Identify the most and least popular genres, tracks, and artists.

Evaluate sales performance across employees and regions.

Analyze revenue trends across time and media types.

Uncover growth opportunities (inactive customers, unsold tracks).
